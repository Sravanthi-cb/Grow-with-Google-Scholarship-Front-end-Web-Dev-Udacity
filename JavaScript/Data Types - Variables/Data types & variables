Directions:
Write an expression that uses at least 3 different arithmetic operators.

The expression should equal 42.

Hint: +, -, *, /, and % are possible arithmetic operators

/*
 * Programming Quiz: First Expression (2-1)
 *
 * Write an expression that uses at least three, different, arithmetic operators

8.Quiz: Converting Temperatures(2-2):

To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can use the following formula:

F=C\times1.8+32 F=C×1.8+32

Directions:
Use this equation and the variables fahrenheit and celsius to print the Fahrenheit equivalent of 12°C.

NOTE: "12°C" reads as "12 degrees Celsius".

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Converting Tempatures (2-2)
 *
 * Use the Celsius-to-Fahrenheit formula to set the fahrenheit varible:
 *
 *     F = C x 1.8 + 32
 *
 * Log the fahrenheit variable to the console.
 *
 */

var celsius = 12;
var fahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32;

console.log(fahrenheit);

Your joke should take the format of a question and answer. The first line should be a question and the second line should be an answer.

Hint: You will need to use special characters to produce the following output.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: All Tied Up (2-5)
 */

var joke = "Why couldn't the shoes go out and play?\" \n\"They were all \"tied\" up!";
console.log(joke);

15.Quiz: Yosa Buson(2-6):

Directions:
Build a string using concatenation by combining the lines from this famous haiku poem by Yosa Buson.

Blowing from the west
Fallen leaves gather
In the east.
Each string should be printed on its own line.

Hint: You will need to use special characters to produce the following output. For a refresher, feel free to review the previous Escaping Strings lesson in this course.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Yosa Buson (2-6)
 */

var haiku = "Blowing from the west\n" + "Fallen leaves gather\n" + "In the east.";
console.log(haiku);

17.Quiz: Facebook Post(2-7):


Look at the picture below and identify which data type (Numbers, Strings, Booleans) would best represent the highlighted areas.

Hint: They’re not all Strings.

Picture cannot be loaded......

  Letter												                          Type

A - Udacity												                        String

B - Meet Christian Plagemann, team						            String
lead for the new VR Developer Nanodegree
program at Udacity!Here he is introducing 
and describing our latest offering

C - blog.udacity.com									                    String

D - Whether something was "liked" or not.				          Boolean

E - 80													                          Number

20 Quiz: Semicolons!(2-8):

Directions:
Define two variables called thingOne and thingTwo and assign them values. Print the values of both variables in one console.log statement using concatenation. For example,

red blue
where "red" is the value of thingOne and "blue" is the value of thingTwo. Don't forget to use semicolons!

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Semicolons! (2-8)
 */

// your code goes here
var thingOne = "red";
var thingTwo = "blue";
console.log(thingOne + thingTwo);

21 Quiz: What's my Name?(2-9):

Directions:
Create a variable called fullName and assign it your full name as a string.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: What's my Name? (2-9)
 */

// your code goes here
var fullName = "Sravanthi Balabhadrapatruni";

22.Quiz: Out to Dinner (2-10)

Directions:
Create a variable called bill and assign it the result of 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15 (don't perform the calculation yourself, let JavaScript do it!). Next, create a variable called tip and assign it the result of multiplying bill by a 15% tip rate. Finally, add the bill and tip together and store it into a variable called total.

Print the total to the JavaScript console.

Hint: 15% in decimal form is written as 0.15.

TIP: To print out the total with a dollar sign ( $ ) use string concatenation. To round total up by two decimal points use the toFixed() method. To use toFixed() pass it the number of decimal points you want to use. For example, if total equals 3.9860, then total.toFixed(2) would return 3.99.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Out to Dinner (2-10)
 */

// your code goes here
var bill = 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15;
var tip = 0.15 * bill;
var total = bill + tip;
console.log("$"+ total.toFixed(2));

23.Quiz: Mad Libs(2-11):

Directions:
Mad Libs is a word game where players have fun substituting words for blanks in a story. For this exercise, use the adjective variables below to fill in the blanks and complete the following message.

"The Intro to JavaScript course is __________. James and Julia are so __________. I cannot wait to work through the rest of this __________ content!"
var adjective1 = "amazing";
var adjective2 = "fun";
var adjective3 = "entertaining";
Assign the resulting string to a variable called madLib.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: MadLibs (2-11)
 * 
 * 1. Declare a madLib variable
 * 2. Use the adjective1, adjective2, and adjective3 variables to set the madLib variable to the message:
 * 
 * 'The Intro to JavaScript course is amazing. James and Julia are so fun. I cannot wait to work through the rest of this entertaining content!'
 */

var adjective1 = 'amazing';
var adjective2 = 'fun';
var adjective3 = 'entertaining';

// your code goes here
var madLib = "The Intro to JavaScript course is " + adjective1 + ". James and Julia are so " + adjective2 + ". I cannot wait to work through the rest of this " + adjective3 +" content!";
console.log(madLib);   

24. Quiz: One Awesome Message (2-12):

Directions:
Here are two awesome messages:

"Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games."
"Hi, my name is James. I love baseball. In my spare time, I like to read."
Declare and assign values to three variables for each part of the sentence that changes (firstName, interest, and hobby).

Use your variables and string concatenation to create your own awesome message and store it in an awesomeMessage variable. Finally, print your awesome message to the JavaScript console.

/*
 * Programming Quiz: One Awesome Message (2-12)
 *
 * 1. Create the variables:
 *     - firstName
 *     - interest
 *     - hobby
 * 2. Create a variable named awesomeMessage and, using string concatenation 
      and the variables above, create an awesome message.
 * 3. Print the awesomeMessage variable to the console.
 */
 
/*
 * Notes:
 * - Using the above as an example, firstName would have been assigned to
 *   "Julia", interest to "cats", and hobby to "play video games".
 * - Be sure to include spaces and periods where necessary!
 */

// Add your code here
var firstName = "Julia" ;
var interest = "cats";
var hobby = "play video games";

var awesomeMessage = "Hi, my name is "+ firstName + "." + " I love " + interest + "." +  " In my spare time, I like to "+ hobby + ".";

console.log(awesomeMessage);
