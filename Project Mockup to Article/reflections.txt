Apart from HTML, CSS. I got to learn on Browser Developer Tools which is the most important for the Front-end Developer:
Browser Developer Tools.. 
Every modern web browser includes a powerful suite of developer tools. 
These tools do a range of things, from inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested 
and how long they took to load..

Inspecting the HTML elements. Working out on different situations. 

I have put all my learning skills and abilities to develop the first project..
